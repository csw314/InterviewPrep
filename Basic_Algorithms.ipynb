        "\n",
        "**Depth-first search** (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm. Given a starting point (also called a “source” node), DFS explores as far as possible along each branch (path) before “backtracking” and exploring other branches. This is in contrast to **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, which explores neighbors of a node first before going deeper.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Ideas\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Go Deep**: From the starting node, pick a neighbor to explore, then move to that neighbor’s neighbor, and so on—going deeper until you cannot continue.\n",
        "2. **Backtrack**: When you reach a node that has no unvisited neighbors, you go back (“backtrack”) to the previous node and look for other unvisited neighbors.\n",
        "3. **Visited Set**: To avoid visiting the same node multiple times and getting stuck in cycles, keep track of the nodes you have already visited.\n",
        "4. **Stack (or Recursion)**: DFS can be implemented using a stack data structure explicitly or by using recursion (which implicitly uses the call stack).\n",

        "1. **Choose a starting node** in the graph.\n",
        "2. **Mark the starting node as visited** (for example, by adding it to a `visited` set).\n",
        "3. **Explore one neighbor** of that node that is not yet visited:\n",
        "   - **Recursively** call DFS on the unvisited neighbor (or push it onto a stack if using an iterative approach).\n",
        "4. **Repeat** until:\n",
        "   - You have visited all nodes reachable from the start.\n",
        "   - Or, if you need to visit every node in a potentially disconnected graph, you would call DFS on each unvisited node from a global perspective.\n",

        "2. **Connected Components**: If you need to find connected components in an undirected graph, you can run BFS from an unvisited node, mark all reachable nodes, then pick another unvisited node and repeat, until all nodes are visited.\n",

        "- **Data Structure**: BFS uses a **queue**; DFS can be implemented with a **stack** or **recursion**.\n",
        "- **Visited Mechanism**: Always maintain a visited set or list to avoid infinite loops, especially when dealing with graphs that have cycles.\n",
        "- **Ordering**: BFS visits nodes in a “sweeping” fashion from left to right (or in the order neighbors are discovered), while DFS goes deep first.\n",
        "- **Time Complexity**: For a graph with \\(V\\) vertices and \\(E\\) edges, the time complexity is \\(O(V + E)\\) because each vertex and edge is processed at most once.\n",
        "- **Space Complexity**: Can be \\(O(V)\\) in the worst case for the queue (if a layer has a very large number of nodes).\n"
