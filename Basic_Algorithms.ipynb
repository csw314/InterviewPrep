        "### Depth-First Search\n",
        "\n",
        "Depth-first search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm. Given a starting point (also called a “source” node), DFS explores as far as possible along each branch (path) before “backtracking” and exploring other branches. This is in contrast to Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores neighbors of a node first before going deeper.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Ideas**\n",
        "1. Go Deep: From the starting node, pick a neighbor to explore, then move to that neighbor’s neighbor, and so on—going deeper until you cannot continue\n",
        "2. Backtrack: When you reach a node that has no unvisited neighbors, you go back (“backtrack”) to the previous node and look for other unvisited neighbors.\n",
        "3. Visited Set: To avoid visiting the same node multiple times and getting stuck in cycles, keep track of the nodes you have already visited.\n",
        "4. Stack (or Recursion): DFS can be implemented using a stack data structure explicitly or by using recursion (which implicitly uses the call stack).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conceptual Steps**\n",
        "1. Choose a starting node in the graph.\n",
        "2. Mark the starting node as visited (for example, by adding it to a visited set).\n",
        "3. Explore one neighbor of that node that is not yet visited:\n",
        "  - Recursively call DFS on the unvisited neighbor (or push it onto a stack if using an iterative approach).\n",
        "4. Repeat until:\n",
        "  - You have visited all nodes reachable from the start.\n",
        "Or, if you need to visit every node in a potentially disconnected graph, you would call DFS on each unvisited node from a global perspective.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Graph Representation**\n",
        "Before coding DFS, you typically need a way to represent your graph. Common representations include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Adjacency List: A dictionary (in Python) or list of lists, where graph[u] contains a list of neighbors of u.\n",
        "- Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array/matrix where each cell (u, v) indicates whether there is an edge from u to v. (This is less common in Python due to memory usage unless your graph is dense.)\n",
        "For clarity, we’ll use an adjacency list representation."
